    	We are sorry but your premium account trial period has ended. In order to receive referrals from other providers with basic accounts you will need to upgrade to a PREMIUM ACCOUNT. Once your account has been upgraded to a premium account you will be able to send and receive referral information to any account. The recipient of your referrals will NOT need to upgrade to a premium account.  Please follow this link to <a href="" ng-click="upgrade()">upgrade your account</a>.
